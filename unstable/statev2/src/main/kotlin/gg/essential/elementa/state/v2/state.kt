 * [func] is called (it is however guaranteed to always see a consistent view of all other [State]s).
 * To have an external system react to changes in the State system (i.e. for it to "have an effect"), use [effect].
 *
 * The two main use cases for [memo] are:
 * - [func] represents a non-trivial / expensive computation which you do not want to re-evaluate on each access
 * - [func] simplifies its dependencies (e.g. picks one item out of a list) and you do not want its dependents to
 *   unnecessarily be re-evaluated even though the simplified value is unchanged (e.g. whenever any other entry in the
 *   list is changed)
 *
 * If neither of the above applies, consider simply creating a custom [State] implementation which computes your [func]
 * every time its [State.get] is called (e.g. instead of `memo { myState() + 1 }` write `State { myState() + 1 }`).
 * Doing so has significantly lower overhead (just the cost of a single lambda) than [memo].

 * Runs the given function [func] once immediately and whenever any of the [State]s it [observes][Observer] change.
 *
 * A "cleanup" function is returned which when invoked will unregister the effect, such that it will no longer be called
 * thereafter.
 *
 * Hint: If a [State] you wish to use often has unrelated changes you do not care about, consider breaking it down into
 *       a smaller [State] ahead of time using [memo].
 *
 * ### Lifetime
 *
 * The effect registration is weak by default.
 * This means that it may be garbage collected if no other strong references to the returned function exist.
 * Once an effect is garbage collected, it will (obviously) no longer be called.
 *
 * Keeping a strong reference to the returned function is easy to forget, so this method requires you
 * to explicitly pass in an object which will maintain a strong reference to it for you.
 * With that, your effect will stay active **at least** as long as the given [owner] is alive (unless the returned
 * function is explicitly invoked, in which case it ceases operation immediately).
 *
 * In general, the lifetime of your effect should match the lifetime of the passed [owner], usually the thing
 * (e.g. [UIComponent]) the effect is modifying.
 * If the owner far outlives your effect, you may be unnecessarily running your effect and leaking memory because owner
 * will keep all those effects and anything they reference alive far beyond the point where they are needed.
 * If your effect outlives the owner, then it may become inactive sooner than you expected and whatever it is
 * updating might no longer update properly.
 *
 * If you wish to manually keep your effect alive (by holding on to the returned function), pass [ReferenceHolder.Weak]
 * as the owner.
 *
 * ### Recursion
 *
 * You should avoid calling [MutableState.set] from the given function.
 *
 * While the State system does support recursion, such nested state changes cannot be performed atomically and as such
 * it is very much possible that another [effect] has already observed both the value that trigger your [effect] but
 * also the old value of the state you want to update;
 * it will then be invoked again which, depending on what it does, may have unintended consequences.
 *
 * To have the value of [State] depend on one or more other [State]s, use [memo] to create it.

/**
 * The base for all Elementa State objects.
 *
 * State objects are essentially just a wrapper around a (potentially computed) value with the ability to subscribe to
 * changes.
 *
 * The primary advantage of using state is that a single state object can be shared between multiple
 * components or constraints as well as re-used and combined to derive other State from it.
 * All in a declarative way, i.e. no need to manually go and remember to update every piece of GUI, you only update
 * the base [MutableState] instance, and everyone who cares will have subscribed (directly or indirectly) and
 * automatically be updated accordingly.
 *
 * This allows one value update to be seen by multiple components or constraints.
 * For example, if a component has many text children, and they all share the same
 * color state variable, then whenever the value of the state object is updated, all of the text
 * components will instantly change color.
 *
 * State also composes well, e.g. a function which returns a `State<Boolean>` for whether a component is hovered can
 * easily be mapped to one or more `State<Color>` (potentially taking into account other state too) which can then be
 * used to color the background/outline/etc. of the same or other components.
 *
 * The most important primitives of the State system:
 * - To create a simple [MutableState] which can be updated manually, use [mutableStateOf].
 * - To create [State] which derives its value from other [State], use [memo] or a custom [State] implementation (see
 *   the documentation on the former for details).
 * - To make external systems react to [State] changes, use [effect].
 *
 * The Elementa State system also provides a bunch of more subtle functionality that may not be apparent at first
 * glance. E.g. it will allow state and effect nodes to be be garbage collected when they are no longer needed, and it
 * will generally guarantee that all views of the State system are consistent, i.e. when there are states derived from
 * other states, you'll either see the old value of all of them, or the updated values for all of them, but never an
 * inconsistent mix of the two.
 *
 * Those readers familiar with other reactive/signal libraries (e.g. SolidJS, Leptos, Angular, MobX) may notice
 * many similarities to these because [State] is pretty much Elementa's solution to the same set of problems.
