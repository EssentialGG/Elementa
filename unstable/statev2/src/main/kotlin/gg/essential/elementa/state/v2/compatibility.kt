 * to the bound state. Instead the new value is stored internally and returned until the input state changes again, at
 * which point it'll be overwritten again.
 *
 * Using such a state (`input.map { it }`) with a `rebindState` method and direct getter+setter methods for the state
 * content was a common anti-pattern used in many places throughout Element.
 * To preserve backwards compatibility for this behavior, this method exists to quickly construct such a state in the v2
 * world.
 * New code should instead just use a regular delegating state and have the setter rebind it to a new immutable state.
