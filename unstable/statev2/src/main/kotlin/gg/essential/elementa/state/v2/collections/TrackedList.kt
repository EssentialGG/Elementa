/**
 * An immutable List type that remembers the changes that have been applied to construct it, allowing one to very
 * cheaply obtain a "diff" between it and one of the lists it has been constructed from.
 *
 * The exact meaning of "very cheaply" may differ depending on the specific implementation but should never be worse
 * than `O(n+m)` where `n` is the size of both lists and `m` is the amount of changes that have happened between
 * two lists. In the best case it should just be `O(m)`.
 *
 * If two unrelated tracked lists are compared with each other, the result will usually just equal [Change.estimate],
 * which takes `O(n)`.
 *
 * Beware that even though lists of this type appear to be immutable, they are not guaranteed to be internally immutable
 * (for performance reasons) and as such are not generally thread-safe.
