/**
 * Wraps a value (e.g. a [Long]) and tracks all operations applied.
 * This allows the original owner of the value to know how it is used and, crucially, whether a different value would
 * give different results.
 *
 * Implementations will provide various utility methods to operate on the contained value in a tracked way.
 * Any time such an operation is performed on the value, [changesAt] is called with the nearest value(s) that
 * would give a different result.
 * E.g. If the value of a [ObservedLong] is 5 and the user calls `lessOrEqual(7)`, that call will return `true`
 *      and `changesAt(8)` is called because 8 would be the closest value to return `false`.
 *      If `lessOrEqual(3)` is called, `false` is returned and `changesAt(3)` is called because 3 would be the
 *      closest value to return `true`.
 *      If `toString()` is called, `"5"` is returned and `changesAt` is called once with 4 and once with 6 because
 *      any change in either direction will give a different result.
 *      Note that while for these simple examples, `changesAt` is only called exactly as often as necessary and with
 *      the exact value at which the change happens, this is not a strict requirement; it may be called multiple times
 *      and/or with values closer than the next change; the only requirement is that at least one call must be at or
 *      closer than the point at which the change happens, such that if we always re-evaluate a computation at the
 *      closest point, we won't miss the change.
 *
 * To get the underlying value, one may call [getValue]. Since the returned value can not be tracked any further from
 * that point on, this will cause the computation to be re-evaluated if the returned value changes in any way.
 * To get the value without subscribing to all changes, use [untracked] and manually call [changesAt] as appropriate.
