 * [gg.essential.elementa.components.Window]s. This allows Elementa to evolve without breaking mods which rely on old,
 * suboptimal behavior.
 *
 * This opt-in, if supplied to [gg.essential.elementa.components.Window]'s constructor, will only be active during the
 * Window's draw call (or any other affected methods, if extended by a future version).
 * To opt-in to the new behavior outside of these methods, you may use [enableFor].

     * This Elementa version improves the behavior of mouse input in three ways
     *
     * 1. In Minecraft versions <=1.12.2, the game calculates the position of the mouse input in an integer context
     * relative to scaled pixels. However, Elementa uses real pixels to determine the position of components leading
     * to situations where certain components or parts of components are not clickable due the game truncating the fractional part.
     * This Elementa version improves this behavior by restoring the fractional component of mouse clicks to the mouse positions
     * in [gg.essential.elementa.WindowScreen.onMouseClicked] if it is not already present
     *
     * 2. Minecraft mouse click input is positioned in the top left corner of a pixel. As a result, the left and top pixel of
     * a component do not register clicks and components with a width or height of 1 are also not clickable. This Elementa version
     * improves this behavior by offsetting mouse coordinates to the center of the real pixel.
     * In particular, [gg.essential.elementa.components.Window.mouseClick] will add half a real pixel to the passed
     * coordinates and [gg.essential.elementa.UIComponent.getMousePosition] will add half a real pixel to the returned
     * coordinates.
     * As a result, if you have previously relied on the exact distance between a click and a component, beware that
     * this value will now be off by up to half a real pixel compared to what it used to be. If required, you can get
     * back the original real-pixel-aligned value by rounding down to the nearest real pixel via
     * [gg.essential.elementa.utils.guiHint].
     * E.g. if the user clicks on the MC pixel at 3/4 with their GUI scale set to 2, the click used to be processed at
     * 3.0/4.0, but with this change it will appear at 3.25/4.25 (because 0.25 is half a real pixel at scale 2).
     *
     * 3. [gg.essential.elementa.components.Window] will now call the new [gg.essential.elementa.UIComponent.dragMouse]
     * override (the one using Float) instead of the old one (using Int). This allows the drag listeners to receive
     * high quality mouse coordinates (including the two changes above) but it may be breaking if you rely on an
     * override of that method. If you do, then you should switch to using the new override at the same time as you
     * upgrade to the new version (or override both if you need to maintain support for old versions).
